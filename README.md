# Dimitar Enev

My name is Dimitar and I am from Bulgaria.

I have an inexhaustible curiosity for new knowledge, technologies and in general how things work from the inside.

My experience consists of API development using Spring and Quarkus frameworks, mainly with Java.

As for deploying what I've developed, I prefer user-friendly self-installing APIs using Docker containers.

I have experience with C, C++, C# and Python in my learning process, but purely amateurish.

I am attracted to how to develop artificial intelligence with TensorFlow and Java.

I am also studying the basics of Quality Control (QA), expanding my knowledge of the IT industry as a whole.

Take a minutes to review my hobby projects.
