# Hello dear viewer! 👋

My name is Dimitar and I am from Bulgaria. 🇧🇬

I have an inexhaustible curiosity for new knowledge 📚, technologies 💻 and in general how things work from the inside. 💡

My experience consists of API development using Spring and Quarkus frameworks, mainly with Java. ☕

As for deploying what I've developed, I prefer user-friendly self-installing APIs using Docker containers. 🐋

I have experience with C, C++, C# and Python in my learning process, but purely amateurish. 🎲

I am attracted to how to develop artificial intelligence with TensorFlow and Java. 🤖

I am also studying the basics of Quality Control (QA), expanding my knowledge of the IT industry as a whole. ℹ️

Take a minutes to review my hobby projects. 🔍
